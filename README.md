The API was created with [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin).

## Running

In order to run you must create a passwords.json from the config/passwords-example.json.

You can run this like an other go program, but a Makefile is included for convenience.

#### Commands using Makefile

* 'make' used to start in development mode
* 'make prod' used to start production server
* 'make stop' used to stop both dev and production processes
